This is a recreation of my original clon of geoguessr I made almost 13 years ago (repo for that is here: https://github.com/webdevbrian/whereami). It's now rebuilt in react and deployed on vercel Check it out here! -> https://whereamiv2.vercel.app/.

# Description
Idea based off of geoguessr. This was a weekend project I did just to come up with a first version. Feel free to pull, and add PRs on bugs you find (I know there are quite a few, which I'll get around to fiddling with on rainy days!).

Also, Please get your own google maps API when you start toying around with it.  ~~Google tracks the amount of API hits ... so please get your own :)~~ You'll now need to add your own API key in your `.env` file for obvious reasons :). Have fun! ðŸ¤©
